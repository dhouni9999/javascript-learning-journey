//De- Structure way to Write Object

/*
âœ… What is Destructuring of Objects in JavaScript?
Destructuring is a shorthand syntax in JavaScript used to extract values from objects or arrays and assign them to variables in a cleaner, readable way.
ðŸŽ¯ Why Use Destructuring?
Benefit         	                    Description
âœ… Cleaner code	                       Reduces repetition like obj.key everywhere.
âœ… Improves readability	               Easy to see what values you're using from an object.
âœ… Works in function parameters	       Can directly pull fields from objects passed to functions.
âœ… Avoids deep dot chaining	           Prevents needing to chain like user.profile.contact.email.*/

const {courseInstructor} = course //Destructured Way 
console.log(course.courseInstructor ) // Traditinal Way  => (.)dot chaining not cleaner code

console.log(courseInstructor) //Destructured Way Output will be same 

//We can make it also Reduce the value of key for our own convience

const{courseInstructor: instructor}=course ;

//now rather than using courseInstructor we can just use  instructor for our desered result highly useful for Devlopment in React 

console.log(instructor)
